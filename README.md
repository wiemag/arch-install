- arch-2-raid.sh

	WARNING!
	THIS IS NEITHER FINISHED WORK NOR WILL IT BE FINISHED SOON OR EVEN EVER. It depends on author's spare time and good moods. BEING A WORK IN PROGRESS THESE SCRIPTS MAY BE DANGEROUS TO USE, with an exception of the first one. DO NOT USE THEM.

However, they may be treated as a check list for arch linux installation or a base for further development.
