Arch Linux Installation Helper Scripts
--------------------------------------


These (bash) scripts help install arch linux:
- set language, fonts and keyboard
- prepare GPT disks
- set up RAID (type 5 or 1)
- encrypt the RAID
- create lvm2 
- install arch linux on such a hardware/software setup
Note that arch linux installation media run in zsh shell.

The scripts names suggest the order of use.

- arch-1-lang.sh
- arch-2-raid.sh

	WARNING!

	THIS IS NEITHER FINISHED WORK NOR WILL IT BE FINISHED SOON OR EVEN EVER. It depends on author's spare time and good moods. BEING A WORK IN PROGRESS THESE SCRIPTS MAY BE DANGEROUS TO USE, with an exception of the first one. DO NOT USE THEM.

However, they may be treated as a check list for arch linux installation or a base for further development.
